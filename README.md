# Translit!
> Get rid of it and complete your dissertation!

Translit! is a tool designed for translating your clipboard text which is super useful when reading academic essays as you may lose your attention and dismiss the key point on which you should really need to focus, especially when you have just entered a certain field.  
The back-end translation service is provided by Sogou which is considered to be the best practice to translate literature for Chinese students.
